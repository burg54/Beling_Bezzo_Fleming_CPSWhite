\section{Research Goals and Approaches}\label{sec:approach}

We propose to focus on three research thrusts that aim to \todo{1, 2, and 3...}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Thrust 1: ...}

\boldheading{Goals and Challenges:} 

\boldheading{Approaches and Preliminary Work:} 

\NB{Here I can talk about the work that I'm doing on safe reinforcement learning and supervised/unsupervised learning. Basically the library of known vulnerabilities and the previous observations of the attack effects on specific systems together with the resilient techniques results can be seen as training data for the new system or for the system operating in different conditions under attack}

\NB{We can assume for now that this operation is done at pre-planning, offline but it would not be too hard to do th same online}

\boldheading{Future Work:} If successful, this project will extend our preliminary work by\todo{by ``future work'' I mean the work we'll do if this is funded}
