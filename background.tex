\section{Background and Related Approaches}\label{sec:background}
A bit about traditional defense and its limitations, some of our work (and others') on resilience, etc
\NB{I think we need to pick 1 or more techniques that have been well developed like my resilient state estimator or the resilient kalman filter and use those to both motivate the problem and use them to show how to transition to other applications and platforms}
