\section{Integration and Validation Plan}
This multidisciplinary research requires expertise in a number of areas, a tight collaboration among its team members, and a close integration of all phases of the research. The primary expertise needed includes \todo{controls, decision-making, modeling...} The team consists of experts in all of the areas and the rough team breakdown is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:testbed}. The PIs are all members of the Link Lab, whose mission is to enhance excellence of CPS research at the University of Virginia. They and all of their students will be sitting together on a daily basis in a 17,000 square foot collaborative lab. They will formally meet as a group once per week but subgroup meetings and impromptu meetings will take place on a daily basis.

While significant research progress will occur in each subproject, we emphasize a rigorous plan for integration throughout the project. This includes a periodic interactive activity called the\todo{something related to exercising our theory on a testbed, which we will describe below. Nicola, do you have boilerplate on the stuff in your lab?}
